2D ULTRA Spine Reduced Model Simulation
=====================

This is the two-dimensional model of the ULTRA Spine tetraheda, using rigid-body dynamics.
Simulations available in both Simulink and MATLAB.
Currently, the focus is on a single tetrahedron.

As of 2016-02-23, development on this project has been moved away from this repository.
This code was moved to a private repository within the Berkeley Emergent Space Technologies Lab.
